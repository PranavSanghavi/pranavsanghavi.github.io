abstract: I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics | Harvard & Smithsonion / Harvard College Observatory, Harvard university, working with Dr. Liam Connor. Togther we are building a next generation FRB detector called the Coherent All Sky Monitor (CASM) to help unravel the mysteries of Fast Radio Bursts by detecting a large sample of local Universe FRBs. I was a post doctoral associate at Yale University, Department of Physics. I am working with Dr. Laura Newburgh on the Candian Hydrogen Instensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) project. I earned by Ph.D. from West Virginia University, inder the supervison of Dr. Kevin Bandura. where I built an interferometric array to localize fast radio bursts (FRBs) to submilliarcsecond precision using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI). My reseach intersts are ni radio astronomy instrumentaiton and data analysis to help detect faint and ellusive cosmological signals.
