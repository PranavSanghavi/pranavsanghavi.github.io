<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>


Hello! I am Pranav Sanghavi, I am a postdoctoral fellow at the Center for Astrophysics &#124; Harvard & Smithsonion / Harvard College Observatory, Harvard university, working with [Dr. Liam Connor](https://liamconnorastro.com). Together we are building a next generation FRB detector called the Coherent All Sky Monitor (CASM) to help unravel the mysteries of Fast Radio Bursts by detecting a large sample of local Universe FRBs. 
	
Before this postion I was a post doctoral associate at Yale University, Department of Physics. I worked with  [Dr. Laura Newburgh](https://physics.yale.edu/people/laura-newburgh) on the Candian Hydrogen Instensity Mapping Experiment (CHIME) project. 
	
I earned by Ph.D. from West Virginia University under the supervision of [Dr. Kevin Bandura](https://community.wvu.edu/~kmbandura/). There I built an interferometric array to localize fast radio bursts (FRBs) to submilliarcsecond precision using very long baseline interferometry (VLBI).

When not building radio telescopes and crunching data, one can find me making <a
    href="https://m.soundcloud.com/pranav-sanghavi">music</a> and <a href="https://dimensionslost.com/">painting</a>. I
enjoy long walks and consuming copious amounts of all art and books. I am an avid home cook who occasionally cooks
specials as a guest chef at a local restaurant for fun!
